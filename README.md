# Reactjs Application

## Prerequisites
* node js
* npm

## Setting up the Project

Please make sure to install nodejs and npm on your system before coming here. 

- Open your command prompt (Windows) and run the following command `npm i -g create-react-app`. Linux and Mac users, run the command `sudo npm i -g create-react-app`. 

  - This will download and install `create-react-app` command-line utility on your system on a global level. Simply saying you can use the command `create-react-app` from any folder.

- Now go to your desired location using `cd` and run `create-react-app reactProjectName`
  
  - This will create a basic react project and your project structure looks like this:

  ```
  reactProjectName/
    README.md     <- Readme file talking about the project
    node_modules/ <- Dependencies are stored here
    package.json  <- Stores downloaded dependencies in json file
    public/       <- Public folder has Templates and the assets 
      index.html  <- Page Template
      favicon.ico <- Image Asset
    src/          <- Source Code
      App.css
      App.js      <- Actual App
      App.test.js
      index.css
      index.js    <- Javascript entry point
      logo.svg
